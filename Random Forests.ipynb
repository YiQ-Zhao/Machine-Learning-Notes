    "Suppose we have a model fit to set of training data. We denote the training set by $Z = (z_1, z_2, ..., z_N)$ where $z_i = (x_i, y_i)$. The basic idea is to randomly draw datasets with replacement from the training data, each sample the same size as the orignal training set. This is done $B$ times, producing B bootstrap datasets. Then we refit the model to each of the bootstrap datasets, and examine the behavior of the fits over the B replications."
